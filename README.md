A Conceptual Roadmap of "The Culture of Time and Space" 
========
In this project I wanted to visually display the interdisciplinary and non-linear approach to presenting history that Stephen Kern takes in his book ("The Culture of Time and Space). To do this I extended the timeline into a 'timegrid', where each column differentiates the topics such as 'Literature', 'Technology', and 'Visual Arts'. The colored lines connect events/developments in seemingly disparate topics based on the Kern's analysis in the book.
